# Welcome to MediaKit

*Build your MediaKit-based player, without constraints. Designed for modularity and ease-of-use. MediaKit inspired by declarative approach in SwiftUI and want to make player development no more complex than UI develop.*

# Why MediaKit?

The main motivation of *MediaKit* is simple: to help developers, easy and fast develop a player. Develop a player is complex, and there are many complex components. _MediaKit_ provides high level abstractions (similar _LazyList_, _VStack_, _HStack_ and etc in _SwiftUI_) combined which you can create a player.
